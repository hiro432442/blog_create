description: Generate new blog post themes based on technical trends, lifestyle issues, and future technology.
---

1. **Analyze Current Trends (Optional)**
   - If you want the themes to be based on the very latest news, ask the agent to "search for the latest engineering trends in [Web/AI/Cloud/etc]".
   - Otherwise, the agent will use its internal knowledge base of perennial and emerging topics.

2. **Generate Themes**
   - The agent will generate 3 distinct themes:
     1. **Technical Problem**: A specific, relatable struggle or anti-pattern (e.g., "The trap of premature optimization").
     2. **Life/Health**: A topic addressing the physical or mental well-being of engineers (e.g., "RSI prevention for keyboard warriors").
     3. **Future Tech**: A forward-looking topic about emerging technologies or paradigm shifts (e.g., "The post-Kubernetes era").

3. **Output Format**
   - Title: Catchy and descriptive.
   - Summary: A 1-2 sentence description of the angle/argument.
   - Target Audience: Who this appeals to (e.g., Juniors, Seniors, Managers).

4. **Refinement**
   - Ask the user to select one or refine the list.
