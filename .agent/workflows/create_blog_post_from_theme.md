description: Create a high-quality technical blog post based on a specific theme using a structured 5-step process.
---

1. **Step 1: Research**
   - Research the latest trends (2024-2025) related to the theme.
   - Extract 5 key topics. Focus on "Why it's important now" and "What problem it solves".
   - Output: Bulleted list of trends with deep insights.

2. **Step 2: Outline Creation (Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu)**
   - Create a heading structure (H2, H3).
   - Structure:
     - **Ki (Intro)**: Empathy with user pain points.
     - **Sho (Development)**: Explanation of the 5 trends/solutions. "No silver bullet".
   - **Ten (Twist/Warning)**: Cultural/Process aspects, pitfalls of just using tools.
     - **Ketsu (Conclusion)**: Actionable advice for the engineer.
   - *Note: Do not use literal "Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu" or "Introduction/Development/Twist/Conclusion" (or Japanese equivalents: 起承転結, 序章, 展開, 転換, 結末) in headings.*

3. **Step 3: Image Preparation**
   - Create diagrams or header images using available tools (e.g., SVG generation, Mermaid).
   - Place generic placeholders if generation is not possible.

4. **Step 4: Writing**
   - Write in Markdown.
   - Target: Mid-to-Senior Engineers.
   - Tone: Professional yet engaging, "Voice of Experience".
   - Length: ~10,000 characters (comprehensive).

5. **Step 5: Review & Save**
   - Proofread for tone, logic, and typos.
   - Save to `posts/[Theme_Name].md`.
   - Notify the user upon completion.
